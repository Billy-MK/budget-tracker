# Offline Budget Tracker

## Description

This project was intended to exercise my ability to create an app with offline functionality. Transactions in a budget tracker are recorded using Mongoose and a NoSQL Database when the user is online. When the user is offline, transactions are instead recorded using IndexedDB. The transactions will be added to the NoSQL database when the user goes back online, and the IndexedDB database is cleared.

## Installation

No installation required.

## Usage

Visit the deployed application through the Heroku link, and start recording transactions. To test offline functionality, disable your internet connection in DevTools and begin recording transactions while offline. Then, go back online, and refresh the page. Your offline transactions should display correctly as if they were recorded while online.
